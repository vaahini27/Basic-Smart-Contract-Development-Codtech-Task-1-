# Basic-Smart-Contract-Development-Codtech-Task-1-
 This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the CODTECH Internship Program. The task involves developing a basic smart contract using Solidity for a token transfer system similar to ERC-20 standards. The smart contract allows for transferring tokens between Ethereum addresses, approving spenders, and using delegated transfers.
